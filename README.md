This is Fish Weight dataset I obtained from Kaggle.com 

The whole purpose of this exercise is to play around learning rate and see how the cost function is affected by it without using all 4 features. I probably needed to find covarinance between the features and integrate 4 lengths and height altogether to predict weight accurately.
